    Scenario: Restore a course quiz and verify every WIRIS question is preserved and editable

        When I backup "Course 1" course using this options:
            | Confirmation | Filename | wiris_all_types.mbz |
        And I restore "wiris_all_types.mbz" backup into a new course using this options:
            | Schema | Course name       | WIRIS Restored |
            | Schema | Course short name | C1_RESTORED    |
        Then I should see "WIRIS Restored"
        # Questions are restored into the new course's question bank.
        And I am on the "WIRIS Restored" "core_question > course question bank" page
        And I should see "TF WIRIS"
        And I should see "MC WIRIS"
        And I should see "SA WIRIS"
        And I should see "Essay WIRIS"
        And I should see "Match WIRIS"
        And I should see "Cloze WIRIS"
        # The restored quiz remains accessible (course-scoped navigation avoids name clashes).
        And I am on "WIRIS Restored" course homepage
        And I follow "WIRIS Quiz"
        And I should see "WIRIS Quiz"
